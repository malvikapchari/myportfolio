Hi! My name is Malvika Patrachari. I am nineteen years old
and have just finished my sophomore year of college at Rutgers
University. I started off my college career in the pre-med track
with a major in psychology, but my interests led me to change
paths and attempt to pursue a different major, Computer Science.
I am still debating a minor, but am leaning towards mathematics.
</p>
<p>
In my free time, I love spending time with my younger sister
(featured in the photo), with friends and with family. Other than
that I enjoy practicing Indian classical dance (called Bharatanatyam).
</p>
<p>
A few years ago, I performed my longest solo Bharatanatyam performance
that lasted about three and a half hours. This solo performance is
called an arangetram.
